# Statigraph
Static blog generator written in go

## What it does
You feed it some blog posts, some formatting templates, and some static styling content, and it'll spit out a folder with a ready-to-use blog heirarchy that you can stick in your site.

## Yeah?
Yep

## Cool.

## So how do we use it?
build it with `go build -o statigraph` then run `statigraph ./my_input_folder ./my_output_folder`
